					Postcard exchange (sometimes called &ldquo;Postcrossing&rdquo; after the first website that was created to fascilitate
					this hobby) allows people to send and receive real postcards. The joy of this card is the ability to connect with a
					random person somewhere around the world, which is very important in today&apos;s world, where an e-mail is considered
					the least technical means of communicating, and many of us feel very isolated from one another.
