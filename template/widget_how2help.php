<h3>Send beautiful postcards to others</h3>
<p>
	At the end of the day the reason for this project is to exchange postcards. When you send at least one
	postcard for each ID that you have received, you are already doing a lot.
</p>

<h3>Introduce Happy Postcard to others</h3>
<p>
	Just like the first point, this project will prosper if more people are using it. If you know other people
	who partake in postal exchange, let them know about Happy Postcard, so that everybody will be happy.
</p>

<h3>Help financially</h3>

	difficult to pay sometimes due to the war.
