		Development has started a long time ago. Alpha testing began on 2023-10-01, and Beta testing on 2023-11-12.
		Finally on 2024-06-12 the site is in the condition where i (the <a href='/user/v010dya'>developer</a>) am
		satisfied to call it a working site. It does not mean that everything is perfect, there is still much work
		to do, but i hope that we can grow our community while i continue to work on things.
