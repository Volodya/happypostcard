<h3>What is «Postal/Postcard Exchange»?</h3>
<p>
	Postal exchange is the act of exchanging anything via post with strangers all over the globe. And
	postcard exchange is the subtype of the above, where postcards specifically are exchanged.
	Postcard exchange is often called «postcrossing» after the first postcard exchange website.
</p>
<h3>How to get started?</h3>
<p>
	First you need to <a href='/register'>register</a> and <a href='/login'>login</a>. After that you will
	be able to <a href='/send'>send postcards</a>. At the same time other users will be sending cards to you,
	once you receive them, you <a href='/receive'>register those cards</a>.
</p>
<h3>I am in a country with several spoken languages/used scripts. How should I write my address?</h3>
<p>
	You should always have an address using Latin characters, regardless of your location. Whether we like it or not,
	this is a de facto standard. This site is written in English for a reason.
</p>
<p>
	If your country has other writing systems or spoken languages, please fill out the address in all of them.
	For example, if you are from Japan, write the address in rōmaji and then add another one in shinjitai, 
	and when you are feeling very smart add kyūjitai. If you are from Belarus, write in Latin alphabet, and
	then both Russian and Belarussian in Cyrillic.
</p>
<h3>Where to get postcards?</h3>
<p>
	If you are just starting you can visit some book stores, that many times have some tourist postcards for
	your location. Museums also many times have cards for sale showing their expositions or depicting subjects
	related to theirs. Then you can check out online shops, there are many of them.
</p>
<h3>Where to get postage?</h3>
<p>
	This really does depend on where you are. Some countries will serve all your postage needs at a local
	postoffice, while others may require you to order stamps online (at least if you want to get interesting
	non-standard stamps).
</p>
<p>
	It is acceptable to use a postage sticker that some postoffices use to mark the fact that the postage
	has been paid. However, almost universally people are more happy when they receive cards with
	stamps that have interesting images, especially of those match the theme of the card.
</p>
<h3>Where to go to send postcards?</h3>
<p>
	This, too, depends on what country you are in, or even where you are in that country. Almost all the places
	allow one to send postcards at a local postoffice, but some have post boxes set up at the different locations.
	In some places it is possible to even have the mail carrier that brings you mail to take the cards that you have
	signed.
</p>
<h3>What do I write on a postcards I am sending?</h3>
<p>
	You absolutely <strong>must</strong> write a number, so that the receiver can register the card. The number
	is given to you and will be in the form of LOC-LOC-2023-101, where LOC is the location of first sender and
	then the receiver of the postcard. Unless you are sending a card in an envelope, you must write an address.
	Everything else is up to you. It is perfectly OK to just say «Here is a Happy Postcard for you.» but many
	people like to share a little bit about themselves, about the card… Some people write the the weather now,
	what music they are listening to while signing, share plans for the future, maybe even share an interesting
	anecdote about one's life. It is also a custom by many people to decorate their card with stickers, stamps,
	drawings or doodles.
</p>
<p>
	Be creative!
</p>
<h3>What is a «postcard»?</h3>
<p>
	Believe it or not, this is a cause of contravercy in this hobby. If you send rectangular, non-folding
	cardboard that have an image on one side and address, postage, and a place for your writing on the other,
	you will always make people happy. But many users will be glad to receive folded greeting cards, official
	postal cards (with address and postage on one side and text on the other), shaped cards, and hand-made
	cards. A few users actually request their cards sent in an envelope.
</p>
<p>
	Still unsure? Send what you would like to receive yourself and be happy to call it a card.
</p>
<h3>Is postcard exchange the same thing as philacardy or deltiology?</h3>
<p>
	Philacardy and deltiology is the act of collecting and studying postcards. Many people who engage in
	postcard exchange also collect some types of postcards. However, it must be noted that in postcard exchange
	it is the sender who has the final say on what postcard is being sent. Demanding specific cards is rude, and
	refusing to register a card that has been received is a potential ground for termination of an account.
</p>
<h3>What if there is a subject that triggers me emotionally?</h3>
<p>
	Happy Postcard provides field in your profile to let people know of phobias that you may have. Put them there
	if you cannot deal with some subjects, so that people know to tryto avoid such themes. Keep in mind, that it may
	still be possible that a person simply doesn't have another postcard to send you.
</p>
<h3>How often may I send a postcard?</h3>
<p>
	For now there are no arbitrary restrictions. When the community will grow, we may start limiting the number of
	travelling postcards that somebody may have. For now the limit is that the site needs to have an available address
	to give you.
</p>
<p>You randomly get an address when the following are <strong>not</strong> true:</p>
<ol>
	<li>You have a travelling postcard to that user that is sent within 2 months</li>
	<li>You have a sent card to that user that has arrived and was sent within 2 weeks</li>
	<li>User is waiting to receive 5 postcards, but has sent nothing</li>
	<li>User is waiting to receive 15 postcards, but none of their sent cards have arrived</li>
	<li>The user sent out less than half of what is sent to them</li>
</ol>
<h3>Where to write the code of the card?</h3>
<p>
	Write it on the card itself. Write it clearly and legibly somewhere not too close to the address and stamps.
	If you write too close to the address it is possible that the mail couriers will get confused and interpret
	it as a part of it. If you write too close to the stamps it's possible that the cancellation will make your ID
	impossible to read.
</p>
<p>
	Some people prefer to write the code more than once, to make it easier to be found. This is a good idea, but is
	not needed most of the time.
</p>
<h3>What to do if I cannot figure out the code of the card that I have received?</h3>
<p>
	Short answer is: <a href='/help'>contact</a> and provide as much information as you can. If you can make out
	even a small part of the code, this may help out a lot to locate the correct one.
</p>
<h3>How late may I register the card?</h3>
<p>
	You should strive to register the card as soon as it is possible after it arrives, but sometimes you cannot
	do it right away, so just register it at your earlies convenience. Happy Postcard does not have any period after
	which the card can no longer be registered. Even if the card has arrived after travelling for 3 years, you have
	received it, and that is all that matters!
</p>
<h3>How early may I register the card?</h3>
<p>
	It is a very bad idea to register the card before you are physically holding it. There are a few exceptions to
	this, a sender writing you and asking to register because they think that the card has gotten lost is
	<strong>not</strong> one such exception.
</p>
<p>
	The site gives out the address of the person more when their cards have arrived, by registering before the card
	is received you make it unfair for other people on this site. You also can create a culture where people do not
	send cards at all, and just claim that they do.
</p>
<h3>What if the card gets lost?</h3>
<p>
	Unfortunately this is the fact of this hobby. In other words: It is not «if they get lost», but «when they get lost».
	When you receive the address, you are expected to send a card. But then that is it. You may, however, try to send
	a second card with the same number in order to hope that it will actually arrive.
</p>
<p>
	What you should <strong>not</strong> do is request that another user registers your card, even though they did
	not get it. This is rude and uncalled for behaviour.
</p>
<h3>Should I tell a person, that I have sent a card to them?</h3>
<p>
	Don't. Let it be a surprise. Happy Postcard already tells the person that they are going to receive a card from
	somebody, that is more than enough information for the unspoiled expectation.
</p>
<h3>How and when did Happy Postcard start?</h3>
<p>
	The <a href='/user/v010dya'>developer of this site</a> is a very engaged postcrosser, who sends out many
	postcards and is on many different sites. Unfortunately sometimes there are no available receivers and also
	there are features that are not present on other websites. For example, there was only one site (that is now
	closed) that allowed a user to represent not a country, but a region within a country.
</p>
<p>
	The development began in 2021, with hopes to make the site public that same year. Unfortunately it took more time
	to complete, and the alpha testing started on 2023-10-01, and beta testing open to all on 2023-11-12.
